## About
An issue tracker for use in debugging or managing projects by small-to-large groups. [Click here to use the live demo!](https://adb-issuance.herokuapp.com/)

## Motivation

I wanted a project which would encourage me to improve at both front-end design and back-end implementation, and this was my destination. I've always wanted more specialized task-tracking software, and this was my first iteration of it.

## Installation & Setup

* Requires a running instance of 

1. Download the project.
2. Install the dependencies using `yarn`.
3. Run `yarn build` to compile the client-side.
4. Run `yarn start:server` to start the server.
5. Run `yarn start:ui` to start the client.
6. Visit `localhost:3000` to view the results!
