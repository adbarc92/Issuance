Issuance Dev Notes

=== 05Mar2021 ===

* Things to Add:
	* Personnel can only be assigned tickets from projects of which they are part
	* 
* Things to Fix:
	* ProjectCard should display Tasks and Assigned Personnel :onHover
	* ProjectCard bottom-right button should be a vertical action menu
X	* ProjectCards should truncate Titles
	* ProjectPersonnel is an unnecessary table;
		* People are not assigned to projects, they are part of projects by virtue of being assigned tickets that are associated with projects;


=== 02Mar2021 ===

* Feature: Personnel Page Actions should work

* Issue: navigating from the personnel table to a person page results in an undefined user being displayed
* Issue: if the app has been reloaded from 

* Feature: React-Router Authentication

=== 26Feb2021 ===

* Person Page will not load, despite Links on the PersonnelTablePage changing the URL
* Based on the Network tab, the `useGetPersonById` requests are not proxying correctly

* Furthermore, a weird discrepancy: the `useGetPersonnel` hook passes its ancestor hook, `getPersonnel` to `useGetData` directly, as opposed to passing a callback as all of the others do...
